## Calculation

How to estimate a web project's cost.

In our calculation method we have divided each of the three main parts into three parts. This model goes, consequently, from a single block for the minimum to twenty-seven blocks for the maximum. The number of blocks is directly related to the annual cost of a project.

The graph not only gives us the result of the effort to be made, it also tells us which direction this effort should go.

<table><tr><td>
The three factors we measure:

- Purpose, the main finality of the site.

- Tarjet, people object of the action.

- Environment, where it will be carried out.

It gives you an idea of cost and related mode.
